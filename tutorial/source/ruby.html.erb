  <p class="rubyTitle"> Welcome to the Ruby tutorial for CSE 3901!</p>
  <p class="sectionTitle">Introduction:</p>
    <p class="writing"> 
    	The purpose of this tutorial is to ease you into the use of the Ruby programming language which is used heavily in the CSE 3901 course.  While Ruby has some aspects which you are familiar with from Java, it also has many key differences as well.  The goal of this tutorial is to highlight these differences and to apply what you know about Java to Ruby.  This document will provide the  basic nuances of the Ruby programming language as well as some examples.  Welcome to the wonderful world of Ruby! 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="sectionTitle">Data Types and Variables</p>
  <img class=" rubySide smallImg" src="images/class.gif" alt= "ruby class tree">
  <p class="writing">
  	The first key aspect of Ruby is to understand that everything is an object. It is object-oriented like Java, but everything is an object. This includes the simple "integer primatives" (in Ruby they are objects from the Fixnum class) you are accustomed to in Java.  Also in Ruby, there are classes as well.  Ruby uses classes for inheritance.  The image to the right is an execellent illustration of object/class heiherarchy.
  	Classes will be expanded upon soon.  One of the first things you were taught in the software sequence was each primative variable has a data type, which must be declared when the variable is declared and initialized. In Ruby, there are no data types! See the example below: 
  </p>
  <pre><code class="ruby">
  x = 31
  puts x => 31
  x = "doggie"
  puts x => doggie
  </code></pre>
  <p class="writing">  
  	As you can see, the variable x was first made an int, then later changed to a string. There is no type declaration at any point and was changed very easily! Ruby has classes that are similar to Java primative data types among other and more:
  </p>
  <table>
  	<th> Java</th><th>Ruby</th>
  	<tr>
  		<td> String</td><td>String</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td> int</td><td>Bignum,Fixnum</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td> double</td><td>DNE</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td> DNE</td><td>Ranges</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td> null</td><td>nil</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td> this</td><td>self</td>
  	</tr>
  	<tr>
  		<td> arrays of same type</td><td>mixed type</td>
  	</tr>
  	</table>
  <p class="writing">The last table row is a neat feature; let's look at an example.</p>
  <pre><code class="ruby">
  #Java
  	int [] myArr = [1,2,5,6,7];
  	#all values must be of same primitive type, and static length;
  #Ruby
  	myArr =[1,2,"three",[4,5,6]]
  	# arrays are dynamic, can contain different value types; integers, strings and an array all in one!
  </code></pre>
  <p class="writing">Another quick note: If you haven't noticed yet, ';' at the end of statements in Ruby are optional.  In fact, it is convention to leave them off!</p>
  <p class="sectionTitle"> Math and Logical Operators</p>
  <p class="writing">
  	The math and logical operations in Ruby work almost identical to they way they do in Java. The basic operators of '+,-,/,*' all work the same way.  '%' is modulo, not remainder, so take care to mind this difference.  When dividing a negative number (-1/3) in Ruby, it rounds towards -infinity, not 0.  A new operator is the '**' which is for exponents.  Logical operators have some old and new flavors to them.  Ruby still has the standard '||,&amp;&amp;,!,!=,==', and also adds the words 'and,or,not'; however, the words take lower precedence.  Ruby has arithmetic and logical concatination as follows '+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,**= &amp;&amp;,||='.  One missed feature in Ruby is the '++,--' operations. A big pitfall for new students making the transistion from Java to Ruby is the '==' and '.equal?'
  	operation.  Let's look at this example.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="ruby">
  	word1,word2 ="same","same"

  	word1 == word2 => true #Have the same value

  	word1.equal? word2 => false #different reference id

  	word1.eql? word2 => false #Checks for value and reference id

  	##Remember, everything is an object!

  	Note:  # is used for comments in Ruby, not // like in Java.

  <p class="sectionTitle">Loops/Conditionals</p>
  <p class="writing">
  Flow control is important in any program that has to respond to any sort of input. Loops and conditional statements are how we accomplish that goal.
  </p>
  <p class="writing">
  The cool thing that Ruby's syntax allows is for you to write your loops and conditionals in a logical way that makes sense to your eyes, without all the special enclosing characters like {} or ().
  </p>
  <p class="writing">
  When you use loops or conditionals in Ruby, the code you want to enclose doesn't need to be put inside braces, and the boolean statement doesn't need parentheses. All you need to do is indent the code you want to enclose and you're good! Simple, looks great, and makes sense.
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class = "ruby">
  n = 1
  while n &lt; 10 do
    n *= 2
    puts n
  end

  =>2
  =>4
  =>8
  =>16
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  Ruby does not like frills and unnecessary writing, just like programmers! Ruby wants simple code, and only the bare minimum, as shown here.
  </p>
  <p class="sectionTitle">While Loops</p>
  <p class="writing">
  While loops are the same while loops you recognize from any other languages you have used. But as we all know, exact syntax is important with computers. The format of a while loop is actually somewhat flexible, as there are a couple different ways syntactically correct while loops can be written.
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class="ruby">
  while condition [do]
    code
  end
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  Note that the "end" statement is required, but the "do" is not! You must separate the conditional statement from the code with either a "do" or a newline and an indent.
  </p>
  <p class="writing">
  What if you have just one line of code to run? It seems like a waste to write out the whole structure. Ruby has the answer. You can use "while" as a modifier, using this syntax:
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class="ruby">
  code while condition
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  If you want a do-while loop (a loop that always executes once, then checks the condition), you can do that too! Be wary, though, it's not called a do-while loop anymore, as it uses the keyword "begin"
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class="ruby">
  begin
    code
  end while condition
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  Simple! Here is an example of those three loops at work:
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class="ruby">
  i = 0

  #regular while loop
  while i &lt; 5
    i += 1
  end

  #1-line while modifier
  i += 1 while i &lt; 10

  #begin-while loop 
  begin
    i += 1
  end while i &lt; 15
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  Another feature of Ruby is the "until" loop and modifier. "until" is essentially "while not", but makes more intuitive sense. You can use "until" in any way you could use "while".
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class="ruby">
  i = 0

  #until loop
  until i > 5
    i += 1
  end
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="sectionTitle">For Loops/Each Loops</p>
  <p class="writing">
  For loops are also critical for most languages. Ruby's take on for loops is a bit different from what you're used to, however. The general syntax:
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class="ruby">
  for var in expression
    code
  end
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  That may have been a little confusing, especially to those of you who are used to writing for loops in C or Java. Like we've mentioned before, Ruby is very direct and minimalistic, so the condition and modifier have been removed, and it uses one expression to cover the number of times the loop will be executed. This is where the Range object comes in handy. Let's translate from C/Java to Ruby:
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code>
  #For-loop in Java
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    system.out.println(i);
  }

  #Same for-loop in Ruby
  for i in 0..9
    puts i
  end
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  See the difference? Ruby again, is terse and simple. The Ruby loop assigns each value in the range 0..9 to i and runs the loop once for each different value. 
  </p>
  <p class="writing">
  Ruby also implements for-each loops, but also in a new way. An example:
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class="ruby">
  #Each loop
  (0..9).each do |i|
    puts i
  end
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  Notice the '|' operators surrounding the variable to be changed. This shows it being used with a range, but it can be used with other data types, such as arrays, as you'll see later on.

  </p>

  <p class="sectionTitle">If/Else Statements</p>
  <p class="writing">
  If loops are the backbone of efficiency, conditional statements are the backbone of choice and control. "If" statements allow the programmer to control different paths of the code. These statements are, of course, presented in Ruby without frills. Here's the basic syntax:
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class="ruby">
  #If statement
  if condition [then]
    code
  end
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  Look familiar? Almost the same as a while loop. "If" statements tend to be very similar to while loops in syntax. Like the [do] with a while loop, the [then] is optional, and can be replaced by a newline and an indent. Of course, you can use the "elsif" and "else" keywords to create more cases and the default case. Like so:
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class="ruby">
  #If-elsif-else example
  if i == 0
    puts "i is zero"
  elsif i &lt; 0
    puts "i is negative"
  else
    puts "i is positive"
  end

  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  Of course, you'll notice that it uses "elsif", instead of "else if". No unnecessary writing allowed. The "elsif" syntax is the same as "if" syntax, and "else" syntax is as simple as can be.
  </p>
  <p class="writing">
  Just like while loops, you can use if as a modifier for 1-line statements.
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class="ruby">
  #If as a modifier
  puts "i = 0" if i == 0
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  However, you should not use "elsif" or "else" when using "if" as a modifier. 
  </p>
  <p class="writing">
  Like "until" for while loops, there is a keyword for an "if not" statement, "unless". You can use "unless" the same way you would use an "if" statement. If you really want to, you can use "else" with an "unless" statement, but it is not recommended, since you could replace that with an if-else structure.
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class="ruby">
  #unless statement
  unless i &lt;= 0
    puts "i is positive"
  end
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  If-elsif-else structures are vital, so use them well!
  </p>
  <p class="sectionTitle">Case Statements</p>
  <p class="writing">
  If you've coded in C, Java, or many other languages, you're probably familiar with switch-case statements. Ruby has case-when statements, which do all of the same things.
  </p>
  <p class="writing">
  Here are the differences with keywords. Case statements start with the "case" keyword, with the variable to be used. The possible values start with a "when". All other values fall under the "else" statement. Here's an example:
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code class="ruby">
  #case statement

  case weather
  when "snowy"
  	puts "It's too cold!"
  when "rainy"
  	puts "It's too wet!"
  when "windy"
    puts "It's too blustery!"
  else
    puts "It's a beautiful day!"
  end
  </code>
  </pre>
  <p class="writing">
  Now that you've seen it, it makes sense. Remember, no parentheses needed, no braces needed, nothing more than is necessary.
