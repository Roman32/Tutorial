    <p class="writing"> The purpose of this tutorial is to ease you into the use of the Ruby programming language which is used heavily in the CSE 3901 course.  While Ruby has some aspects which you are familiar with from Java, it also has many key differences as well.  The goal of this tutorial is to highlight these differences and to apply what you know about Java to Ruby.  This document will provide the  basic nuances of the Ruby programming language as well as some examples.  Welcome to the wonderful world of Ruby!

  <p class="writing">The first key aspect of Ruby is to understand that everything is an object. This includes the simple "integer primatives" (in Ruby they are objects from the Fixnum class) you are accustomed to in Java.  Also in Ruby, there are classes as well.  Ruby uses classes for inheritance.  The image to the right is an execellent illustration of object/class heiherarchy.
