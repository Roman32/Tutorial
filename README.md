## To Run
Navigate to the tutorial folder (the folder where the 'source' folder is one of the items in your current directory). From there, open a terminal window and run "bundle exec middleman build", then "bundle exec middlman server". After that, open your web browser and navigate to "localhost:4567". Feast your eyes upon your beautiful webpage.

## Contributions
Please list who did what for each part of the project, and if anyone [pair programmed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) in this section.

* Roman: 

* Sina: Wrote "header" partial. Wrote HTML/CSS page, along with the examples that it had. 

* Tom: Created the content for the JavaScript section of the website, including all of the example code and demonstrations.

* Steven: 

* Zach: 

## Testing
We tested the site manually, by building the site and running the middleman server and then clicking through the links in the site, all the while paying attention to the web console for any error messages. We also validated our HTML documents via the HTML validator.
